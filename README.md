# Miller_Lab5

A boilerplate/housing structure for a blog. It was listed in lab assignments but was never actually assigned so it was abandoned before it was even begun.

Will be creating soon and populating with posts and galleries from my trip. 

Layout:
Home page with hero image, welcome text, and "Inertia", "Momentum", "Synergy" posts using SAP along bottom. Top Nav contains:"Images","National Parks", "Journal Entries"
